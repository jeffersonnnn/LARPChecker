# LARPCheck ü§ñ

LARPCheck is a Twitter bot that analyzes GitHub repositories for potential AI/LLM hallucinations in documentation and code comments. It helps developers identify and verify AI-generated content in their codebases.

## Features

- üîç **Automated Repository Analysis**: Analyzes GitHub repositories for potential AI-generated content
- üê¶ **Twitter Integration**: Responds to mentions with `analyze` or `check` commands
- üìä **Detailed Reports**: Provides comprehensive analysis of AI hallucinations in code
- üöÄ **Easy to Use**: Just tweet `@YourBotUsername analyze https://github.com/username/repo`

## How It Works

1. **Mention the Bot**: Tweet at your bot's account with the `analyze` or `check` command and a GitHub repository URL
2. **Repository Analysis**: The bot clones and analyzes the repository for:
   - AI-generated documentation
   - Code comments and descriptions
   - Potential hallucinations or inconsistencies
3. **Report Generation**: Receives a detailed report about findings

## Getting Started
